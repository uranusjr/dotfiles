# My Dot Files

A collection of useful dotfiles. Many OS X-specific things, and require certain dependencies, e.g. Homebrew formulae (git-completions), rbenv, pyenv.

## Usage

A simple Python script "linkthem" can be sed to link files into the home directory. Run

    ./linkthem --help

for details.

## Copying

Don't really want to bother putting up a license for this. Please ask me first before re-using anything.
