# My Dot Files

A collection of useful dotfiles. Many OS X-specific things, and require certain dependencies, e.g. Homebrew formulae (git-completions), rbenv, pyenv.

## Known dependencies

* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
* [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

### Dependencies from Homebrew

* diff-so-fancy
* pcre (for pcregrep)

## Usage

A simple Python script "linkthem" can be sed to link files into the home directory. Run

    ./linkthem --help

for details.

## Copying

Don't really want to bother putting up a license for this. Please ask me first before re-using anything.
